# üëã Hi, I'm Dmitry Lozovoy

I'm a **security researcher** passionate about uncovering vulnerabilities, developing new attack vectors, and exploring the edges of modern cybersecurity. My work spans several key areas of the security landscape:

---

## Areas of Expertise

1. **Low-Code / No-Code Security**  
   Focused on the **Power Platform ecosystem**, where I identify vulnerabilities and design novel attack techniques targeting platforms like **Power Automate, Power Apps, and Copilot Studio**.

2. **AI Security**  
   Researching and developing attack vectors targeting platforms like Microsoft 365 Copilot, Copilot Studio, ChatGPT, and other LLM ecosystems. My work includes promptware and detections development.

3. **Bug Bounty and Research**  
   Active participant in **Microsoft‚Äôs Bug Bounty programs**, with multiple acknowledgments on the [MSRC recognition page](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/acknowledgement/).

4. **Additional Interests**  
   Deeply interested in **cloud security research**, **APIs**, and **web application security**.

5. **Community Contributions**  
   Contributor to the [GenAI Attack Matrix](https://ttps.ai/), advancing industry-wide understanding of AI attack techniques.
